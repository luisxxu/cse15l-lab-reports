* In order to successfully remotely connect to the ieng6 server, you need to know your username/password and open terminal.
* To find your username and password, you can look it up using your UCSD credentials on this website: [Link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
* On this website, you can reset your password and find your username that should look like this name, with the "zzz" as different characters
  ```
  cs15lwi23zzz
  ```
* To open terminal, go to the top bar of VSCode and hover over "Terminal" and select "New Terminal".
* To connect using ssh, run this command below.
  ```
  ssh cs15lwi23zzz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
  ```
* You should be prompted with entering your password, and after you enter your password, you should be greeted with this screen:

* Now that you're remotely connected to the ieng6 server, you can run several commands to help you navigate and create directories.
* You can try commands like ls, mkdir, and cd. mkdir creates a new directory, and ls lists the contents of the current directory.
* You can see these commands in use in the screenshot below:
