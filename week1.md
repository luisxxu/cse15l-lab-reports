* In order to remotely connect to the ieng6 server, you must use the ssh command.
* Open a terminal in VSCode, and make sure you know your username. 
* Your username should look something like "cs15lwi23zzz" with zzz replaced with other characters.
* Run the command "ssh cs15lwi23zzz@ieng6.ucsd.edu" and enter the password you created for the account. You should be greeted with this screen:
* ![Image][ssh.png]

* Now that you're remotely connected to the ieng6 server, you can run several commands to help you navigate and create directories.
* You can try commands like ls, mkdir, and cd. mkdir creates a new directory, and ls lists the contents of the current directory.
* You can see these commands in use in the screenshot below:

Congrats! You now know how to remotely connect to a server using VSCode's terminal and some basic commands.
